This is the part where I'm learning Angular, doing a lesson where I had 2 Exercises
Exercise 1:
display a property from app.component.ts into app.component.html

Exercise 2:
make a new component with the properties title, content, and isTechRelated
Display Title and content in the app.component.html
make the title change color when isTechrelated is set to true or false

the button and the <p> saying true or false are extra stuff I decided to do


these aren't exactly what the exercises said, I summarised them as short as I could.
